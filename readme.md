# This an example on how one could stitch a K8 cluster across Azure, GCP and AWS using Terraform

It is not a PROD ready example - In fact if you are considering a cluster across hyperscalers  
 strongly consider the reasons why?. 

# When multi cloud Kubernetes is worth it

    It makes sense if
    You sell to regulated industries
    You need regional survivability across providers
    You want leverage in cloud negotiations / costs

# It does not make sense if

    You are early stage
    Your team struggles with one cloud
    You think this reduces complexity

# bottom line - It increases complexity. Full stop.
