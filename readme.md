# This an example on how one could stitch a K8 cluster across Azure, GCP and AWS
# 

# It is not a PROD ready example - In fact if you are considering a cluster across
# 
# strongly consider the reasons why take the paiin. 

# When multi cloud Kubernetes is worth it

    It makes sense if

    You sell to regulated industries

    You need regional survivability across providers

    You want leverage in cloud negotiations

# It does not make sense if

    You are early stage

    Your team struggles with one cloud

    You think this reduces complexity



# It increases complexity. Full stop.
